# Loan Approval Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict loan approval status based on applicant profiles. Key features include Marital Status, Education, Applicant Income, Credit History, and more. The project involves data preprocessing, visualization, and model training using various classification models such as Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression.

**Key Objectives:**
- Predict loan approval status using machine learning models
- Identify key factors influencing loan approval decisions
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy scores

**Methodology:**
- Data Collection: A dataset of loan applications with 13 features
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables
- Model Training: Using various classification models to predict loan approval status
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using accuracy scores

**Results:**
The Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy score of 82.5% on the test set.

**Next Steps:**
- Further tuning of hyperparameters to improve model performance
- Exploring additional features to enhance prediction accuracy
- Developing a user-friendly interface for loan approval prediction

**Codebase:**
The complete codebase, including datset, Jupyter Notebooks and visualizations, is available for further exploration.
